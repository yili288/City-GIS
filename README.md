A map of streets and landmarks of multiple major cities in the world. Uses a multi destination Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy algorithm to solve a courier service problem that is computationally hard. The map determines a legal path that goes through a set of predefined depots, pick up and drop off points.	

GUI elements: search field, map markers, buttons.
